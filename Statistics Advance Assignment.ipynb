They randomly select 30 days and record the sales for each store on those days. Conduct a repeated measures ANOVA using Python to determine if there are any significant differences in sales between the three stores. If the results are significant, follow up with a post-hoc test to determine which store(s) differ significantly from each other.**"],"metadata":{"id":"szLtUnAz7s3F"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import scipy.stats as stats\n","\n","# Generate random data for the example (replace this with your actual data)\n","np.random.seed(42)\n","\n","store_A_sales = np.random.normal(loc=1000, scale=100, size=30)\n","store_B_sales = np.random.normal(loc=950, scale=90, size=30)\n","store_C_sales = np.random.normal(loc=1100, scale=110, size=30)\n","\n","# Combine the sales data and group information into a DataFrame\n","data = pd.DataFrame({'Sales': np.concatenate([store_A_sales, store_B_sales, store_C_sales]),\n","                     'Store': ['A'] * 30 + ['B'] * 30 + ['C'] * 30})\n","\n","# Perform one-way repeated measures ANOVA\n","F_statistic, p_value = stats.f_oneway(store_A_sales, store_B_sales, store_C_sales)\n","\n","# Report the results\n","print(\"One-way repeated measures ANOVA:\")\n","print(\"F-statistic:\", F_statistic)\n","print(\"p-value:\", p_value)\n","\n","# Interpret the results\n","alpha = 0.05  # Significance level\n","\n","if p_value < alpha:\n","    print(\"There is a significant difference in average daily sales between the three stores.\")\n","else:\n","    print(\"There is no significant difference in average daily sales between the three stores.\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"G8Vm1mgool1B","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1716605072300,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1897,"user":{"displayName":"Ravi Kumar Pal","userId":"07351150463644468966"}},"outputId":"7ce70338-c9df-4755-8c1d-f1665339c64c"},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["One-way repeated measures ANOVA:\n","F-statistic: 23.62763182315457\n","p-value: 6.369054894762179e-09\n","There is a significant difference in average daily sales between the three stores.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from statsmodels.stats.multicomp import pairwise_tukeyhsd\n","\n","# Perform Tukey's HSD post-hoc test\n","tukey_results = pairwise_tukeyhsd(data['Sales'], data['Store'])\n","\n","# Report the results\n","print(\"\\nTukey's HSD post-hoc test:\")\n","print(tukey_results)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"T6j5SGR7omUR","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1716605082240,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1783,"user":{"displayName":"Ravi Kumar Pal","userId":"07351150463644468966"}},"outputId":"638a31d8-7dd3-48c5-bc09-3216be5aee9f"},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","Tukey's HSD post-hoc test:\n","  Multiple Comparison of Means - Tukey HSD, FWER=0.05  \n","=======================================================\n","group1 group2 meandiff p-adj    lower    upper   reject\n","-------------------------------------------------------\n","     A      B -42.0899 0.2045 -100.5291  16.3492  False\n","     A      C  120.232    0.0   61.7929 178.6712   True\n","     B      C 162.3219    0.0  103.8828 220.7611   True\n","-------------------------------------------------------\n"]}]}]}
